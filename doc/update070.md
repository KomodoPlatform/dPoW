## dPoW 0.7.0 update information


#### Please update iguana and ensure your NN infrastructure is ready for Season 7.
```
cd ~/dPoW
git checkout master
git pull
```

#### Kill iguana, rebuild and start it

```
pkill -15 iguana
cd ~/dPoW/iguana
./m_notary_build
```

Then launch with `./m_notary_3rdparty` or `./m_notary_main` based on the server. If using [dockerised 3P](https://github.com/smk762/notary_docker_3p), launch Iguana with `./m_notary_3rdparty_docker` so it connects to the alterative ports and paths for the 3P daemons.


#### Open the Iguana P2P ports

Please note that iguana ports were changed to 13348 for main and 13345 3rd party networks
After git pull restart your iguana and adjust your firewall settings accordingly, e.g. :

- `sudo ufw allow 13348/tcp comment 'iguana s7 mainnet p2p'`
- `sudo ufw allow 13345/tcp comment 'iguana s7 3rd p2p' `

If you are a returning Notary Node operator, don't forget to close the Season 6 Iguana ports and the ports for removed coins once Season 7 begins.
